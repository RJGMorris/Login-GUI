# Login-GUI
User Login System with GUI

Using the tkinter module in Python 3 I built a GUI application that allows users to create and account with a
username/password combination and then “login”. All account information is stored in a database I created using
sqlite3. The app consists of two class based views I made, the login page and and create an account page where
the login page is the root and the create an account page in a top level of the root. I had to teach myself how to
use regular expressions so that I could implement a working authentication system for the user's email address and password.
